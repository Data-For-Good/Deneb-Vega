# Deneb-Vega data visualization examples

This repository contains code (JSON) for data visualizations created usig [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/). They are created to be embedded into Power BI reports using [Deneb](https://deneb-viz.github.io/) custom visual, but they also can be embedded into any web page/application. All visualizations published here are based on open data with the data files (CSV) attached.

The published data visualizations are just examples and results of author's experiments with Vega and Deneb. Some of them may still require debugging and code optimization/cleaning. The author is not responsible for the quality, accuracy, reliability or any other aspect of the shared code and data.
