#Radar Charts for Krakow Bicycle Counters report

I created 2 radar charts for my Krakow Bicycle Counters report https://powerofbi.org/krakow-bicycle-counters/?pageName=ReportSection48dfef449877c00bc200
The charts (vega code) are almost identical, but one charts shows annual seasonality (by month), another chart shows weekly seasonality (by day of week)

Radio buttons on the bottom of each chart allows to shitch data agregation level:
- all years and locations average (one line for the average, filled area to show range of annual variations)
- individual years (one line for each year)
- individual locations (one line for each location)
